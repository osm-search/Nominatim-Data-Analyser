                description: addr:place and addr:street on the same object.
                why_problem: Usually an house number refers either to a street or to a larger place. addr:place and addr:street should therefore not be used together.
                how_to_fix: Set only addr:place or addr:street but not both on the same object. Usually addr:place should be changed to something like addr:suburb or addr:city.
