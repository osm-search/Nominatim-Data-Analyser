                  This view shows addresses where the addr:street tag differs
                  from the name of the street that Nominatim has assigned to
                  the address. There are three different reasons that this
                  happens: 1) there is a typo in addr:street or the street name.
                  2) The addr:street part does not refer to a street at all
                     but to a place (village, hamlet, area).
                  3) Road is not mapped yet near address (or tts name is missing) 
                why_problem: |
                  1) The addr:street tag should have exactly the same name as the street.
                  2) addr:street must only be used when the house number is attached
                     to an existing street nearby.
                how_to_fix: |
                  1) Check if there is a typo in the addr:street tag or
                  in the name of the street and fix it.
                  2) If addr:street refers to a place, use change it to addr:place.
                  3) If road is missing, map it
